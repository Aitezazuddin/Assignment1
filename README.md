# Project Information

This project is a spam detection web application that utilizes a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or ham (not spam). 
The model was built using Python and trained on a dataset of labeled emails. The web application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows users to upload a file containing emails to be classified as spam or ham.

## Improvements

To improve the user interface, we added a progress bar to indicate the status of the file upload and classification process. We also added an error message to be displayed if the user tries to upload a file that is not in the correct format.
To improve the model's accuracy, we experimented with different feature extraction techniques and used a larger dataset for training.

### How to Run
